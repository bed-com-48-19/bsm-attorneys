    shortDescription:
      "BSM Attorneys helps parties to resolve disputes amicably by acting as a neutral third-party mediator.",
    mainDescription:
      "In mediation, the parties are helped to reach a mutually acceptable decision, which serves to be non-binding on them. Due to the long-drawn and expensive nature of court proceedings, mediation can be a very strong option for parties to reach a settlement. Many times, especially in matrimonial or commercial disputes, the opposing party is a part of your flesh and blood, a parent, a sibling, a child or a spouse. Due to this sensitive nature of the relationship, both parties may be disinclined to favour litigation in the courts, and so the matter can unnecessarily remain unresolved. So sometimes mediation is the best solution for such cases, since the mediator plays a proactive yet guiding role in the journey to the best possible outcome.",
